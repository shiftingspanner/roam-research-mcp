v1.8.2 - 2026-01-02

feat(cli): add --no-daily-page flag to roam save command (removed in v2.0.2)

Introduces the `--no-daily-page` flag to the save command, allowing users
to create pages without automatically linking them on the current Daily Page.
This is useful for programmatic generation or workflows where a daily log
entry is unnecessary. (Note: This feature was removed in v2.0.2 - pages now
add a "Processed: [[date]]" block at the end instead of linking from daily page.)

Changes:
- Update `save` command to pass `noDailyPage` option to page operations.
- Refactor `createPage` to conditionally skip the daily page link logic.
- Tweak `MemoryOperations` to place the memory tag at the end of the block
  content rather than the beginning.
- Update CHANGELOG.md.

v1.8.1 - 2026-01-02

- ADDED: `roam update` CLI command to update block content by UID
  - `roam update <uid> "New content"` - Update any block
  - Useful for marking TODOs as DONE: `roam update <uid> "{{[[DONE]]}} ..."`

- ADDED: `--no-daily-page` flag to `roam save` to skip "Created page" link (removed in v2.0.2)
  - Useful when linking to the page from another location (e.g., brainstorm workflows)
  - `roam save content.md --title "Page" --no-daily-page`
- ENHANCED: CLI help text clarifies `-i`/`-e` filter on text content, not tags

v1.8.0 - 2026-01-02

- ADDED: TODO/DONE support in CLI commands
  - `roam get --todo` - Fetch all TODO items across the graph

- ADDED: Nested table support in `roam_create_page`
  - Tables with `level: 2` or higher are now created as children of preceding text blocks
  - Uses UID tracking to map each level to its most recent block
  - Tables at level N become children of the last block created at level N-1
  - If no parent found at the expected level, tables fall back to page level

v1.6.2 - 2026-01-01

- FIXED: `roam_create_page` table ordering bug
  - Tables in mixed content were being created at the end of the page instead of inline at their original positions
  - Root cause: Content processing separated text and tables into two sequential batches rather than preserving original order
  - Solution: Refactored to process content items in order, flushing pending text batches before each table insertion
  - Tables now appear correctly after their preceding headings when using the `content` array with mixed types

v1.6.0 - 2025-12-31

- ADDED: `roam refs` CLI command to find blocks referencing a page or block
  - Accepts page titles, `#tags`, `[[Page Names]]`, or `((block UIDs))`

    - Supports both file input and stdin piping
- REMOVED: `roam-import` standalone CLI (functionality merged into `roam save`)
- ADDED: `commander.js` dependency for robust CLI argument parsing
- UPDATED: Package binary from `roam-import` to `roam`

- ADDED: `roam_update_page_markdown` tool
  - Updates existing pages with new markdown content using smart diff algorithm
  - Preserves block UIDs where possible, keeping references intact across the graph
  - Three-phase block matching: exact text → normalized (removes list prefixes) → position-based fallback
  - Generates minimal batch operations: only creates/updates/moves/deletes what changed

v1.3.2 - 2025-12-27

- FIXED: Content duplication bug in `roam_create_page`
  - Added idempotency check to prevent duplicate content when tool is called multiple times
  - Root cause: Duplicate tool invocations (e.g., SSE transport retries, client timeouts) caused content to be created twice
  - If page already has child blocks, subsequent calls return success without adding duplicate content
  - Added test script: `scripts/test-create-page-duplication.ts`

v1.3.1 - 2025-12-27

- ENHANCED: `Roam_Markdown_Cheatsheet.md` attribute usage guidance
  - Added clear rules for when to use `::` attribute syntax vs bold formatting
  - Attributes are for queryable metadata across the graph (Type::, Author::, Status::)
  - Bold formatting (`**Label:**`) should be used for page-specific labels (Step 1:, Summary:)

  - Automatically links the new page from today's daily page
  - Usage: `cat document.md | roam-import "Page Title"` or `pbpaste | roam-import "Ideas"`
  - If page exists, content is appended to it
- FIXED: Markdown parser now handles variable indentation (2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs)
  - Previously assumed 2-space indentation, causing nested items to flatten to root
  - Now dynamically detects indentation levels from the document

v1.0.0 - 2025-12-16

- OPTIMIZED: Server performance and reliability
  - Removed deprecated and non-functional SSE (Server-Sent Events) server implementation.
  - Implemented async file reading and caching for Roam Markdown Cheatsheet and custom instructions to avoid blocking the event loop.

v.0.32.3

- ENHANCED: `roam_create_page` tool
  - Now creates a block on the daily page linking to the newly created page, formatted as `Create [[Page Title]]`.

v.0.32.2

- FIXED: `roam_create_outline` now correctly respects the order of top-level blocks.
  - Changed the default insertion order for batch actions from 'first' to 'last' in `src/tools/operations/outline.ts` to ensure blocks are added in the intended sequence.

v.0.30.10

- ENHANCED: `roam_markdown_cheatsheet` tool
  - The tool now reads the `Roam_Markdown_Cheatsheet.md` and concatenates it with custom instructions from the path specified by the `CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH` environment variable, if the file exists. If the custom instructions file is not found, only the cheatsheet content is returned.
- UPDATED: The description of `roam_markdown_cheatsheet` in `src/tools/schemas.ts` to reflect the new functionality.

v.0.30.9

- FIXED: `roam_fetch_block_with_children` tool to use a more efficient batched recursive approach, avoiding "Too many requests" and other API errors.

  - The content is now read dynamically from `Roam_Markdown_Cheatsheet.md` on the filesystem.
  - **Reason for Tool Creation:** While Cline can access local resources provided by an MCP server, other AI models (suchs as Claude AI) may not have this capability. By exposing the cheatsheet as a tool, it ensures broader accessibility and utility for all connected AI models, allowing them to programmatically request and receive the cheatsheet content when needed.
- REMOVED: Roam Markdown Cheatsheet as a direct resource
  - The cheatsheet is no longer exposed as a static resource; it is now accessed programmatically through the new `roam_markdown_cheatsheet` tool.

  - Updated the "Roam Tables" section with a more detailed explanation of table structure, including proper indentation levels for headers and data cells.
- ENHANCED: `src/tools/schemas.ts`
  - Clarified the distinction between `roam_create_outline` and `roam_process_batch_actions` in their respective descriptions, providing guidance on their best use cases.

v.0.30.1

- ENHANCED: `roam_process_batch_actions` tool description
  - Clarified that Roam-flavored markdown, including block embedding with `((UID))` syntax, is supported within the `string` property for `create-block` and `update-block` actions.
  - Added a note advising users to obtain valid page or block UIDs using `roam_fetch_page_by_title` or other search tools for actions on existing blocks or within a specific page context.
  - Clarified the `block_text_uid` description for `roam_create_outline` to explicitly mention defaulting to the daily page.

v.0.30.0

- DEPRECATED: **Generic Block Manipulation Tools**:
  - `roam_create_block`: Deprecated in favor of `roam_process_batch_actions` (action: `create-block`).
  - `roam_update_block`: Deprecated in favor of `roam_process_batch_actions` (action: `update-block`).
  - `roam_update_multiple_blocks`: Deprecated in favor of `roam_process_batch_actions` for batch updates.
    Users are encouraged to use `roam_process_batch_actions` for all direct, generic block manipulations due to its enhanced flexibility and batch processing capabilities.
- REFACTORED: `roam_add_todo` to internally use `roam_process_batch_actions` for all block creations, enhancing efficiency and consistency.
- REFACTORED: `roam_remember` to internally use `roam_process_batch_actions` for all block creations, enhancing efficiency and consistency.
- ENHANCED: `roam_create_outline`
  - Refactored to internally use `roam_process_batch_actions` for all block creations, including parent blocks.
  - Added support for `children_view_type` in outline items, allowing users to specify the display format (bullet, document, numbered) for nested blocks.
- REFACTORED: `roam_import_markdown` to internally use `roam_process_batch_actions` for all content imports, enhancing efficiency and consistency.

v.0.29.0

- ADDED: **Batch Processing Tool**: Introduced `roam_process_batch_actions`, a powerful new tool for executing a sequence of low-level block actions (create, update, move, delete) in a single API call. This enables complex, multi-step workflows, programmatic content reorganization, and high-performance data imports.
- ENHANCED: **Schema Clarity**: Updated the descriptions for multiple tool parameters in `src/tools/schemas.ts` to explicitly state that using a block or page UID is preferred over text-based identifiers for improved accuracy and reliability.
- NOTE: **Heading Removal Limitation**: Discovered that directly removing heading formatting (e.g., setting `heading` to `0` or `null`) via `update-block` action in `roam_process_batch_actions` is not supported by the Roam API. The `heading` attribute persists its value.

v.0.28.0

- ADDED: **Configurable HTTP and SSE Ports**: The HTTP and SSE server ports can now be configured via environment variables (`HTTP_STREAM_PORT` and `SSE_PORT`).
- ADDED: **Automatic Port Conflict Resolution**: The server now automatically checks if the desired ports are in use and finds the next available ports, preventing startup errors due to port conflicts.

v.0.27.0

- ADDED: SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport support for legacy clients.
- REFACTORED: `src/server/roam-server.ts` to use separate MCP `Server` instances for each transport (Stdio, HTTP Stream, and SSE) to ensure they can run concurrently without conflicts.
- ENHANCED: Each transport now runs on its own isolated `Server` instance, improving stability and preventing cross-transport interference.
- UPDATED: `src/config/environment.ts` to include `SSE_PORT` for configurable SSE endpoint (defaults to `8087`).

v.0.26.0

- ENHANCED: Added HTTP Stream Transport support
- Implemented dual transport support for Stdio and HTTP Stream, allowing communication via both local processes and network connections.
- Updated `src/config/environment.ts` to include `HTTP_STREAM_PORT` for configurable HTTP Stream endpoint.
- Modified `src/server/roam-server.ts` to initialize and connect `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` alongside `StdioServerTransport`.
- Configured HTTP server to listen on `HTTP_STREAM_PORT` and handle requests via `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`.

v.0.25.7

- FIXED: `roam_fetch_page_by_title` schema definition
- Corrected missing `name` property and proper nesting of `inputSchema` in `src/tools/schemas.ts`.
- ENHANCED: Dynamic tool loading and error reporting
- Implemented dynamic loading of tool capabilities from `toolSchemas` in `src/server/roam-server.ts` to ensure consistency.
- Added robust error handling during server initialization (graph, tool handlers) and connection attempts in `src/server/roam-server.ts` to provide more specific feedback on startup issues.
- CENTRALIZED: Versioning in `src/server/roam-server.ts`
- Modified `src/server/roam-server.ts` to dynamically read the version from `package.json`, ensuring a single source of truth for the project version.

v.0.25.6

- ADDED: Docker support
- Created a `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Added an `npm start` script to `package.json` for running the application within the Docker container.

v.0.25.5

- ENHANCED: `roam_create_outline` tool for better heading and nesting support
- Reverted previous change in `src/tools/operations/outline.ts` to preserve original indentation for outline items.
- Refined `parseMarkdown` in `src/markdown-utils.ts` to correctly parse markdown heading syntax (`#`, `##`, `###`) while maintaining the block's hierarchical level based on indentation.
- Updated `block_text_uid` description in `roam_create_outline` schema (`src/tools/schemas.ts`) to clarify its use for specifying a parent block by text or UID.
- Clarified that `roam_create_block` creates blocks directly on a page and does not support nesting under existing blocks. `roam_create_outline` should be used for this purpose.

v.0.25.4

- ADDED: `format` parameter to `roam_fetch_page_by_title` tool
- Allows fetching page content as raw JSON data (blocks with UIDs) or markdown.
- Updated `fetchPageByTitle` in `src/tools/operations/pages.ts` to return stringified JSON for raw format.
- Updated `roam_fetch_page_by_title` schema in `src/tools/schemas.ts` to include `format` parameter with 'raw' as default.
- Updated `fetchPageByTitle` handler in `src/tools/tool-handlers.ts` to pass `format` parameter.
- Updated `roam_fetch_page_by_title` case in `src/server/roam-server.ts` to extract and pass `format` parameter.

v.0.25.3

- FIXED: roam_create_block multiline content ordering issue
- Root cause: Simple newline-separated content was being created in reverse order
- Solution: Added logic to detect simple newline-separated content and reverse the nodes array to maintain original order
- Fix is specific to simple multiline content without markdown formatting, preserving existing behavior for complex markdown

v.0.25.2

- FIXED: roam_create_block heading formatting issue
- Root cause: Missing heading parameter extraction in server request handler
- Solution: Added heading parameter to roam_create_block handler in roam-server.ts
- Also removed problematic default: 0 from heading schema definition
- Heading formatting now works correctly for both single and multi-line blocks
- roam_create_block now properly applies H1, H2, and H3 formatting when heading parameter is provided

v.0.25.1

- Investigated heading formatting issue in roam_create_block tool
- Attempted multiple fixes: direct createBlock API → batchActions → convertToRoamActions → direct batch action creation
- Confirmed roam_create_page works correctly for heading formatting
- Identified that heading formatting fails specifically for single block creation via roam_create_block
- Issue remains unresolved despite extensive troubleshooting and multiple implementation approaches
- Current status: roam_create_block does not apply heading formatting, investigation ongoing
